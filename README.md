# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines based on their composition using advanced machine learning techniques. Two powerful classifiers, namely the Random Forest Classifier and the Decision Tree Classifier, were employed to develop predictive models for this purpose.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to accurately predict the quality of wines using features related to their composition. The project utilizes two prominent machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest Classifier and the Decision Tree Classifier, to create predictive models. These models are trained on a dataset containing wine samples along with their associated quality ratings.

## Key Results

Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an impressive accuracy of over 99% in predicting wine quality. This classifier demonstrates the potential of ensemble learning techniques for accurate quality assessment.

Decision Tree Classifier: Attained an accuracy of around 60%, highlighting the importance of comparing different algorithms for model selection and understanding the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.

## Project Significance

Predicting wine quality is crucial for both consumers and producers, as it can provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to high-quality wines. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to enhance the accuracy of wine quality predictions and contribute to the understanding of the relationships between composition parameters and overall quality.
